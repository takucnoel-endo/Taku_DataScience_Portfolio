**Info**
* Programming language: python
* IDE: Jupyter Notebook 

**Summary**
* Performed a k-means clustering analysis on food nutrition data that I aqquired from kaggle.com.  
* Feature engineered, cleaned, and scaled data using packages including pandas, numpy, and sklearn preprocessing. 
* Visualized 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional plots using packages including seaborn and ployly. 
* Optimized hyperparameter(k) using elbow method
* Applied k-means algorythm using sklearn clustering package. 

# [Supply Chain Lead Time Multivariate Linear Regression / Late Delivery Risk Random Forest Model](https://github.com/takucnoel-endo/SupplyChain-Multivariate-Linear-Regression)   
**Info**
* Programming language: python
* IDE: Spyder(Data Cleaning, Model Building), Jupyter Notebook(EDA) 

**Summary**
* Objective 1: What are the variables that impacts company's lead time, and how? Can we predict company product lead time based on past data? 
* Objective 2: Can we predict whether certain order might be in a risk of late delivery?
