* Programming language: python
* IDE: Jupyter Notebook 
# 
* Performed a k-means clustering analysis on food nutrition data that I aqquired from kaggle.com.  
* Feature engineered, cleaned, and scaled data using packages including pandas, numpy, and sklearn preprocessing. 
* Visualized 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional plots using packages including seaborn and ployly. 
* Optimized hyperparameter(k) using elbow method
* Applied k-means algorythm using sklearn clustering package.
